    <h2>About This Event Booking Website</h2>

    <p class="small">
        This Event Booking Website provides a simple and reliable platform for event organizers and attendees.
        Organizers can create events, set date/time, location, price and available seats. Visitors can browse upcoming events,
        search by category, and book tickets online. The website supports admin management (add/edit/delete events),
        a contact form, and category-based visuals to keep the interface consistent and attractive.
